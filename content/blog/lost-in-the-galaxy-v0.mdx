Hey everybody, Kais here, an indie developer and maker!

I'm excited to announce the start of **the Lost in the Galaxy** release event! But what exactly is it?

## What is it?

Over the next 40 days, Iâ€™ll be building and releasing a number of open source projects in public, including:

- **Developer tools & AI**: Mostly related to Scoopika.

- **Productivity tools**: I've never built these before, so it should be interesting.

- **Entertainment products**: Primarily music-related, since I'm a music lover and plan to create some cool music stuff.

- **AI tools**: Built on top of Scoopika, serving as practical use cases.

## The goal

This is more of a fun experiment than an official event. The main goal is to have fun and contribute to the indie developer community. All the projects will be open source, available for anyone to try and develop further. Iâ€™ll be sharing all the analytics, from high points to low moments.

I believe this will be a treasure trove for those looking to break into the indie development and build-in-public worlds.

## Roadmap

I'm participating in the [backdrop build v5](https://backdropbuild.com/) event, which ends on July 31, 2024. My main focus for July will be my open source AI project [Scoopika](https://scoopika.com),
so that will be the main focus for July, then in the first week of August we're going to build 2 AI-powered products each week on top of Scoopika and launch them on ProductHunt.

In the first week of August, we'll be building and launching two AI-powered products each week 
on top of Scoopika, and launching them on ProductHunt. What products, you ask? You decide! 
We'll have polls to choose the next product to build.

In the last two weeks of August, 
we'll focus on building something music-related and growing the user base 
for what we've built over the previous weeks to thousands of users.

I'll be sharing blog posts, analytics, videos, documentation, and everything open source on GitHub!

## Why "Lost in the galaxy"?

I used to use names like this when I was in school, 
and Iâ€™ve always loved space. Hopefully, by the end of this event, 
weâ€™ll have moved from "Lost in" to "Building".

## Expectations

There are no expectationsâ€”just having fun and building cool stuff.
